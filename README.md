Mini Shell Implementation (v3)

OVERVIEW
========
This project implements a simple shell (command-line interface) in C under Linux. The shell reads user commands, executes them using system calls, and provides additional features including command timing, dangerous command detection, detailed statistics tracking, piping, background processes, error redirection, resource limits, and parallel matrix calculations.

FEATURES
========

Core Features from v1
----------------------

1. Basic Command Execution
   - Reads and executes system commands using fork() and execvp()
   - Supports command input of up to 1024 characters
   - Handles up to 6 command-line arguments
   - Terminates on the "done" command with statistics output
   - Provides error handling for failed commands with ERR_CMD message

2. Informative Prompt
   The shell displays a detailed prompt with the following information:
   #cmd:<count>|#dangerous_cmd_blocked:<count>|last_cmd_time:<time>|avg_time:<time>|min_time:<time>|max_time:<time>>

   Where:
   - #cmd - Number of successfully executed commands
   - #dangerous_cmd_blocked - Number of dangerous commands that were blocked
   - last_cmd_time - Execution time of the last successful command (in seconds)
   - avg_time - Average execution time of all successful commands
   - min_time - Minimum command execution time observed
   - max_time - Maximum command execution time observed

3. Command Timing
   - Measures execution time for each command using clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)
   - Logs detailed timing data to a specified output file in format: <command> : <time> sec
   - Uses a high-precision timer with results in 5 decimal places

4. Dangerous Commands Protection
   - Reads potential dangerous commands from a specified input file
   - Blocks execution of exact matches to dangerous commands with message:
     "ERR: Dangerous command detected ("<command>"). Execution prevented."
   - Warns about similar commands (same command name but different arguments) with:
     "WARNING: Command similar to dangerous command ("<command>"). Proceed with caution."
   - Tracks statistics on blocked and similar commands

New Features in v2
-------------------

1. Pipe Mechanism (|)
   - Supports piping output from one command to another using the | character
   - Requires exactly one space before and after the pipe character
   - Supports single pipe operations (command1 | command2)

2. Internal my_tee Command
   - Custom implementation of the tee command as an internal shell command
   - Reads from standard input and writes to both standard output and specified files
   - Supports the -a (append) option to add content to the end of files rather than overwriting
   - Can write to multiple files simultaneously
   - Example usage:
     command | my_tee file.txt          # Write output to screen and file.txt
     command | my_tee -a file.txt       # Append output to file.txt
     command | my_tee file1.txt file2.txt  # Write to multiple files

3. Resource Limit Mechanism
   - Implements a resource limitation system via the internal rlimit command
   - Allows setting and displaying resource limits for processes
   - Supports four types of resources:
     - cpu: CPU time in seconds
     - mem: Memory size in B, KB, MB, GB
     - fsize: Maximum file size
     - nofile: Maximum number of open files
   - Syntax:
     - rlimit set resource=soft_value[:hard_value] command [args...]
     - rlimit show [resource]
   - Example usage:
     rlimit set cpu=2:3 sleep 10           # Limit CPU time to 2s (soft) and 3s (hard)
     rlimit set mem=50M ./memory_program   # Limit memory to 50MB
     rlimit show                           # Show all current resource limits
     rlimit show cpu                       # Show only CPU resource limits

4. Background Process Support (&)
   - Executes commands in the background when followed by &
   - Returns the prompt immediately, allowing the user to execute other commands while the background process runs
   - Example usage:
     sleep 5 &    # Runs sleep in the background

5. Error Output Redirection (2>)
   - Redirects standard error output to a file using 2>
   - Example usage:
     command 2> error.log    # Redirects error messages to error.log

6. Enhanced Error Handling
   - Comprehensive error detection and reporting based on process exit status
   - Distinguishes between normal termination and signal-based termination
   - Reports specific error signals when processes are terminated abnormally
   - Error messages for different termination scenarios:
     - Normal termination with non-zero exit code
     - Termination due to signals (with signal name displayed)

New Features in v3
-------------------

Matrix Calculator (mcalc)
- Internal command that performs parallel matrix operations
- Supports addition (ADD) and subtraction (SUB) of matrices
- Uses parallel computation with pthreads arranged in a hierarchical tree structure
- Syntax:
  mcalc "matrix1" "matrix2" ... "matrixN" "OPERATION"
- Each matrix is specified in format "(N,N:a1,a2,...,aNÂ²)" where:
  - N,N: Dimensions of the matrix (rows, columns)
  - a1,a2,...: Comma-separated matrix elements
- Operations:
  - ADD: Performs addition of all matrices
  - SUB: Performs subtraction in the order given (order matters)
- Example usage:
  mcalc "(2,2:1,2,3,4)" "(2,2:5,6,7,8)" "ADD"  # Results in (2,2:6,8,10,12)
  mcalc "(2,2:9,8,7,6)" "(2,2:1,2,3,4)" "SUB"  # Results in (2,2:8,6,4,2)
  mcalc "(2,2:1,1,1,1)" "(2,2:2,2,2,2)" "(2,2:3,3,3,3)" "ADD"  # Results in (2,2:6,6,6,6)
- Input validation:
  - Matrices must follow the exact format specified
  - At least two matrices must be provided
  - All matrices must have the same dimensions
  - Operation must be either "ADD" or "SUB" in uppercase
  - Invalid input format results in ERR_MAT_INPUT error

Parallel Computation Model
- Calculations are performed using a hierarchical tree of pthread workers
- For N matrices, the computation forms a tree where:
  - Each level combines pairs of matrices in parallel
  - If there's an odd number of matrices at any level, the last one passes through to the next level
  - Processing continues until a single result matrix remains
- For example, with 4 matrices and SUB operation:
  Final result = ((M1 - M2) - (M3 - M4))
- The tree structure maintains the order of operations, which is critical for subtraction

USAGE
=====

./ex3 <dangerous_commands_file> <log_file>

Parameters:
- dangerous_commands_file: Text file containing dangerous commands (one per line)
- log_file: File where command execution times will be logged

Example:
./ex3 dangerous_commands.txt exec_times.log

INPUT VALIDATION
================
- Maximum command length: 1024 characters (defined by MAX_INPUT_LENGTH)
- Maximum number of arguments: 6 (defined by MAX_ARGC)
- Multiple consecutive spaces between arguments are not allowed
- Empty inputs and input containing only spaces are handled properly

ERROR MESSAGES
==============
- ERR_ARGS: Displayed when more than 6 arguments are provided
- ERR_SPACE: Displayed when multiple spaces are found between arguments
- ERR_MAX_CHAR: Displayed when input exceeds maximum length
- ERR_CMD: Displayed when a command cannot be executed
- ERR: Dangerous command detected ("<command>"): Displayed when a dangerous command is blocked
- Signal-specific messages for abnormal process termination (e.g., "Terminated by signal: SIGSEGV")
- ERR_MAT_INPUT: Displayed when matrix calculator input format is invalid

NOTES
=====
- The shell clears the log file at the start of each execution
- Initial minimum time is set to -1 to ensure it gets properly updated on first command
- Both dangerous and semi-dangerous commands are tracked separately
- The program uses fork() and waitpid() to ensure proper process management
- The my_tee implementation uses basic system calls (read(), write()) rather than stdio functions
- Resource limits are implemented using the setrlimit() and getrlimit() system calls
- Matrix calculator uses pthread library for parallel computation
- The hierarchical tree structure ensures proper order of operations for matrix subtraction
